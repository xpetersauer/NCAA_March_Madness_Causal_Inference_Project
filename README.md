# NCAA_March_Madness_Causal_Inference_Project
This repository contains all the code used in my project in the class 36-318: Intro to Causal Inference at Carnegie Mellon University. The .Rmd file is the analysis pipeline, whereas the .ipynb is the feature engineering pipeline.

# The Dataset Used For This Project:
Since this project was locally ran on my computer, you'll need to download the dataset yourself and change the directory filepaths. For accessing the dataset, you can get that here:

Feel free to experiment with both the Men's and Women's March Madness datasets as well as more years as time progresses! :)
